		<div class=txt-wbel style='padding-top:0px;'>A naturotherapy practitioner since 2006, Sejal Vora is her own best example.</div>
		<div class=txt-wbel>
		A graduate in Political Science (1996, St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai), she soon discovered an innate entrepreneurial spirit. This prevailed and took her away as far as New York. By 2000, she was deeply immersed in a flourishing jewellery business.</div>
		<div class=txt-wbel>Unfortunately, the lifestyle that followed success at a young age was an unhealthy one. The result was an additional 30 kgs in body weight, high blood pressure, recurring tonsillitis, PCOD, skin rashes, frequent headaches and constant fatigue, to name just a few of her ailments. To control these alarming developments she switched to ‘diet’ colas and other such fad foods; quickly realizing the trap it lays for consumers—literally out of the frying pan and into the fire!  But not quickly enough.
It was only at the end of 2004, frustrated with the way her health and fitness levels were dropping, that Sejal decided to move back to Mumbai, padlocking corporate life. 
	</div>
		<div class=txt-wbel>Here she consulted a variety of alternative healers, ranging from yoga masters to hypnotherapists. Drawing from the best of all that she saw and learnt, Sejal came to the clear realization that “food is medicine”.</div>
		<div class=txt-wbel>Practising all of what she now brings to her clients, she not only lost over 30 kilograms over a three-year period, but also cured herself completely and is in peak health for over five years.</div>
		<div class=txt-wbel>Her experiences inspired her to get certified training in Natural Medicine & ThetaHealing. She now works with people with clinical and non clinical illnesses. Having worked with hundreds of patients suffering from chronic colds to cancer, Sejal believes firmly that we need first to change our attitude towards ‘disease’. We need to address ailments with our mind, learn to take charge of our body, learn about correct nutrition and practise it rigorously</div>
		<div class=txt-wbel>This path is the best route from sickness to vibrant recovery and long term health.</div>
