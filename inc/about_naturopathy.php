			<div class=txt-wbel>We live in an age of instant gratification.Finding quick fixes for every kind of discomfort has become second nature for most of us, whether it’s eating out because there’s no time to cook, scheduling a conference call during a commute or popping a pill to cure everything from a headache to heartburn.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>The unfortunate truth is that these methods lead to the onset of real disease which could be obesity, acid reflux, ulcers, diabetes, cholesterol imbalance, high blood pressure, or more commonly, many of these in combination. This leads to more pill popping and more distress, a cycle that eventually proves toxic to body and the mind.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>Naturotherapy on the other hand, is the art of healing yourself naturally by listening to and being in tune with your body. It entails understanding your own mind, body and soul and healing yourself at all levels, simultaneously. It can include a wide variety of treatments ranging from acupuncture, changes in diet to physical therapies involving yoga and various massage techniques.</div>

By treating all of you she creates the highest chances of wholesome healing and peak levels of health.</div>

In this way she brings with her a modern day understanding of nutrition, mind-over-matter wisdom and holistic healing.</div>
