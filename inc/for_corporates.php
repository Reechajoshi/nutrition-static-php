			<div class=txt-wbel>Across organizations, there is a widespread and growing absenteeism, low motivation, poor concentration and poor time management among employees.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>HR programmes try to address and arrest this alarming trend with management tools. It is worthwhile for corporations to simultaneously incorporate naturopathy into the programme.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>Sejal Vora’s tailor made seminars provide employees with the means to discover lost energy, manage time better and be more productive.  Within a matter of weeks, the understanding and practice of naturotherapy methods leads to an overall improvement in the physical and mental well being of employees. When a whole work force is rejuvenated in this way it creates an entirely new, transformed and dynamic work environment.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>For the employees the new found energy extends to all spheres of their lives, giving a joyous meaning to work-life balance.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>Seminars can be hosted for anywhere between 5 to 100 people. Sejal will hold a three-hour talk, an interactive question/answer session, as well as leave each participant with a specially created hamper which will allow them to kick-start their journey to good health and positive eating.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>Sejal’s services are also used by companies while making food choices for canteens and corporate kitchens.</div>
