			<div class=txt-wbel>Allopathic medicine prescribes “on the fly” remedies more than ever before. This makes one feel better for a while. However, since it doesn’t tackle the illness at the root, the problem keeps recurring.
</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>“Listening to what your body is telling you is more important today than ever,” says naturotherapist Sejal Vora who teaches her clients to cure ailments, not with quick fixes but through the unconventional technique of ‘being their own doctor’.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>Therapy begins with a personal consultation with Sejal. It’s a private, three- hour one-on-one in the privacy of the patients’ home. This allows patients to relax and truly be themselves, essential for obtaining a full physical, emotional and psychological perspective of their condition.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>At the end of the session, Sejal makes an in-depth assessment of the patient’s medical history, lifestyle and home environment, enabling her to make an educated recommendation to correct specific problems.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>Treatment always begins with a personalized nutritional balance programme. Sejal has proved time and again that incorrect eating is the physical manifestation of all illness, without exception.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>During this time patients learn the art of understanding their minds and listening to their bodies. In a few weeks, Sejal educates and empowers them to take charge of their health, in an informed and intelligent way.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>This full treatment is spread over six months with access to Sejal. It takes about three months to see holistic results and another three to make naturotherapy a way of life.</div>
			<div class=txt-wbel>Before long, the patient finds a remarkable improvement not just in health but in a new vibrant approach to life, family and work.</div>
