I tried it! found out new things about myself that I didn’t know... got shown striking proof that explained things about me that are very obvious... and came to understand a few amazing things about my own core and foundations, innate strengths and weaknesses.. Basically learnt a lot about myself, and also was shown how the things that I already knew about myself are rooted in the way I’m mapped... and realized how to capitalize from it!
