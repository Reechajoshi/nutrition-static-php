<div class="txt-wbel">“I always thought my child was a slow learner and lacked concentration, all thanks to you I realized that I was doing it all wrong.</div>
<div class="txt-wbel">Using my own perception to understand my child wasn’t getting me any results, after your analysis I have finally understood my child’s perspective and understood his strengths.. Today he has not only improved his concentration, but is also absorbing information way faster as I allow him to use his tactile intelligence to learn.</div> 
<div class="twxt-wbel">Thank you so much Sejal, this is the most ground breaking science and I hope all mothers use it to fully understand their children."</div>

I tried it! found out new things about myself that I didn’t know... got shown striking proof that explained things about me that are very obvious... and came to understand a few amazing things about my own core and foundations, innate strengths and weaknesses.. Basically learnt a lot about myself, and also was shown how the things that I already knew about myself are rooted in the way I’m mapped... and realized how to capitalize from it!
