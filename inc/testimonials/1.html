<div class="txt-wbel">“Sejal is well-prepared and very knowledgeable in her field. She is direct and straightforward. She presented information in a clear and concise manner that was really easy to understand. As associated health issues arose, she made every effort to put me in touch with alternative health professionals to support my healing process.</div> 

<div class="txt-wbel">I had been to many nutritionists at this point; however Sejal presented me with a holistic overview of health, wellness and nutrition that empowered me to take my health into my own hands and make positive choices in my life.</div>
