<div class="txt-wbel">“Sejal is a pioneer in a field that needs to make a resurgence - natural health. She has a wealth of invaluable knowledge that seems to have been lost by western medical practitioners, about how the body really works, why it responds as it does to our lifestyles and behaviours, and how to resolve seemingly intractable health problems through a holistic approach.</div>

<div class="txt-wbel">After you do a session with Sejal, you'll wish you met her ten years earlier -- her solutions are intuitive and effective.” </div>
