<div class="txt-wbel">“Sejal Vora changed my life forever, and quite honestly - saved it. During the course of my first, one on one session with Sejal she pushed me to get a sonography immediately.That is when I was diagnosed with Stage III ovarian cancer. But for Sejal I wouldn't be sitting here today writing this recommendation.</div>

<div class="txt-wbel">Her approach is truly unique: She comes to you, provides an in-depth education for you to truly understand how your body works (busting several myths along the way) and empowers you with all the information you require to listen to your own body.</div>

<div class="txt-wbel">She is NOT a dietician, or a mere nutritionist. She tailor-makes a nutritional plan especially for you, depending on your particular health problem, so that you make a complete lifestyle change - should you want it. It is a wake-up call that you'll be thankful for.</div>

<div class="txt-wbel">If you are ready to change your life, forever - call Sejal. I'm currently cancer-free and owe a major part of my healing to her. My kitchen and lifestyle choices have her stamp all over them.”</div>
