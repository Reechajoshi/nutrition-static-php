<div class="txt-wbel">"We live in a world of fast pace and quick escapes rejoicing ever so smugly, until the demons of our thoughtlessness come to haunt us again". What Sejal's method of healing does is unique and at once logical; she addresses the root cause of the matter that ails one and eradicates it from the bottom up, minimizing health issues and uplifting one’s quality of living. That is key.</div> 

<div class="txt-wbel">What is path breaking is that she also empowers one by imparting knowledge and techniques that one can approach in a simple manner for good health and healing. Sejal is fearless and positive with her dedication to one’s serious health challenges and above all teaches us to be responsible physically, mentally and spiritually.</div> 
<div>The world is a better place with her at the helm of practice and so are we”.</div>
