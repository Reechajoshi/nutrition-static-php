<div class="txt-wbel">“To say that meeting and taking a session with Sejal Vora has been the smartest thing I have done in a long time is an understatement. She is someone whose advice has, over the last two years, helped me quit smoking, almost quit all refined sugars like chocolates and pastries etc (to which I was hugely addicted), changed my approach to exercising and has made me appreciate myself for the healthy, beautiful and happy person that I am, inside and out.</div> 

<div class="txt-wbel">Going natural is the only answer and she made me see that. She has the amazing ability to not enforce change, rather it comes from within, without trying, when one starts to see the hugely positive results that come from following her simple instructions. She has been a very influential force in making lifestyle altering decisions, ones that I am now sure are going to be with me for life, making me a healthy and happy person today and always”.</div>
