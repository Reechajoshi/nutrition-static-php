<div class="txt-wbel">I went to Sejal as a last resort! At 36, while there was nothing very major, I had chronic issues which were hampering my day to day functioning. I have a knee, ankle and back problem and hormonal issues. The usual story, tried and failed at everything. The first thing I learnt from Sejal is that the biggest issue is my attitude towards myself and my body.</div>
<div class="txt-wbel">The second was my approach to food and eating and the third – a very myopic approach to health in general. With her continuous guidance and counselling, I have managed to make a huge shift in my attitude and eating habits and in just a few months, feel much healthier, happier and calmer. My knee has not hurt in 3 months and that is a first after 12 years! Apart from Sejal being an expert in her field, a huge advantage is that she looks at you as a whole entity- body mind and soul - and works with experts in multiple fields to actually identify and heal from the core of the issue.</div> 
<div class="txt-wbel">My recommendation – don’t wait to get sick or fed up, make this a way of life, from TODAY!</div>
